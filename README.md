In this repo I am working through *C++ Primer (5th Edition)*, by Stanley B. Lippman, Jos√©e Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo. My answers to each exercise start with "ex", followed by the chapter number, exercise number, and component of the exercise, if applicable. The topmost comment in each exercise is the exercise prompt, later ones are my own.
