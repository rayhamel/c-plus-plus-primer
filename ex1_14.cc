/*
* Compare and contrast the loops that used a "for" with those using a while. Are
* there advantages or disadvantages to using either form?
*/

/*
* The main advantage of the "for" loop over the "while" loop is that it allows
* for fewer lines of code in many circumstances. Some disadvantages include that
* the English semantic meaning of "for" deemphasizes the conditional aspects of
* a loop as compared to "while", that all 3 statements of a "for" loop are not
* always necessary, as with ex1_13_3, which omits the init-statement, and that
* sometimes a programmer might want to create a loop with more than one or
* variable exit conditions or expressions.
